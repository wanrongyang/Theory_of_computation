# 🤖 Mastering the Theory of Computation 

Welcome to the **COMP218 Weekly Summary Sheets** repository! 🎉 This is your **one-stop resource** for mastering the intricacies of the **Introduction to the Theory of Computation** at **the University of Liverpool**. 

These summaries are carefully crafted to follow the **official course structure** of **COMP218**, week by week, so you’ll always know what’s important at each stage of the semester. From **automata theory** to **Turing machines** and beyond, I’ve got you covered! The aim here is to **simplify complex concepts** and give you the key takeaways you’ll need to ace the course and exams. 💡

If you find these summaries helpful, don’t forget to give the repository a ⭐️ to show your support — every little bit of encouragement helps!

### 📚 What's Inside?

Here you'll find neatly packaged, easy-to-digest **weekly summaries** covering all the major knowledge points from the course. Whether you’re preparing for exams, reviewing lecture material, or just trying to figure out what on earth a **DFA** or **NFA** actually does (don’t worry, we’ve all been there), these summaries are here to help!

**New updates** are dropped regularly, so you can stay up-to-date as we progress through the term. 🛠️💡

### 👩‍🏫 Who Am I?

Hey! I’m **Wanrong Yang**, a PhD student at the **University of Liverpool**, currently working on various AI research topics. I’m also your friendly **teaching assistant** for COMP218! Together, let’s decode all the automata, Turing machines, and computational complexities that come our way. You can learn more about me on my [personal website](https://wanrongyang.github.io/).

### 👨‍🔬 Meet the Professor!

This course is led by the amazing **Dr. Dominik Wojtczak**, who also happens to be my PhD supervisor. If you want to dive deep into his world of theoretical computer science, check out his [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-HObEAYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 

### 🚀 Why This Repo?

The goal is simple: **make the theory of computation less terrifying** and more approachable for everyone. These weekly summaries aim to:
- 🧠 Break down complex topics into digestible bits
- 🔑 Highlight key concepts for exams and assignments
- 👨‍💻 Provide extra resources for deeper understanding (because who doesn’t love a good automaton?)

### 📝 Contribute!

If you spot any errors (hey, we’re all human!) or have suggestions, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue. Let's make this repository even better together!

**Stay computationally curious, and may the automata be ever in your favor!**

*Happy learning, and good luck with COMP218!* 🎉
